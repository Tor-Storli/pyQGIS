"""
Here we are creating a custom map tool that inherits from QgsMapTool 
and overrides the canvasReleaseEvent method. 
This method will be called whenever you click on the map canvas. 

This custom map tool takes two arguments: 
  1) Canvas, which is the map canvas, and 
  2) Layer, which is the vector layer containing the county polygons. 

The canvasReleaseEvent method is called whenever you click on the map canvas. 

The pyQGIS script gets the click location, transforms it to map coordinates, 
and then finds the feature at that location. 
If a feature is found, the pyQGIS script gets the county name 
from the featureâ€™s attributes and constructs a URL for the 
Wikipedia page for that county. 

Finally, The pyQGIS script opens the URL in a web browser 
using QDesktopServices.openUrl.

NOTE: Run the "Create_Color_and_Add_labels.py first to create a VectorLayer to work with!
